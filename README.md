# WebAdvJS_Spring2019

Course Description 

Applications rarely are comprised of a tangled set of static files. They're dynamic. They
update. They remember things. The course will introduce the concepts of a database and
Web applications as a set of design problems. The class will investigate server-side
applications, third-party data sources and APIs and how applications can become dynamic
and highly functional. To approach the design and construction of applications that derive
from data sources and databases, this course builds upon an essential knowledge of Web
Standards, user interface design, and usability to support the creation of functional and
responsive projects for the Web across multiple devices and platforms. Students will
incorporate interaction design, visual design, user experience and code to rapidly sculpt data
into content. By the end of the course, students should be able to design, build and deploy
data-driven Web applications. The course employs a pedagogy suitable for designers, artists
and technologists who seek an empowerment achieved by being able to build data-driven
applications.

We will learn JavaScript properly. Then, we will learn useful design patterns. Then we will pick
up useful tools for making cool things better. 

Learning Outcomes By the successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1.	Strong understanding of JavaScript programing language and its applications.
2.	Ability to leverage from various types of Web APIs available to client browsers.
3.	Clear insight on Client/Server Architecture, communication with Web Servers
4.	Establish an industry standard workflow for building web applications
